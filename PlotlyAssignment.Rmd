```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(datasets)
library(tidyr)
library(plotly)

USPE<- as.data.frame(USPersonalExpenditure)
USPE$category<-c("Food and Tobacco","Household Operation","Medical and Health","Personal Care","Private Education")
USPE<- gather(USPE, Year, Spending, `1940`:`1960`)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
p <- plot_ly(USPE, x = USPE$Year, y = USPE$Spending, type = 'scatter', color=USPE$category, mode = 'lines+markers')
